# ML UnsupervisedLearning  Finding K for Stock Analysis

In this example we are analyzing the pricing data on one of the stocks in our portfolio. Specifically, we're examining the relationship between 
- the day's trading volume 
- and the spread between the high and low trading price.
- We will use the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters, k, that should be used to segment these trades.
- Once the elbow curve has been established, we will evaluate the two most likely values for k using 
    > the K-means algorithm 
    > and a scatter plot.
